This river segment follows part of the flow of Opequon Creek near Berryville, VA. Gage 01615000 is located in Frederick County, VA (Lat 39 10'29", Long 78 04'42") approximately 5.0 miles west of Berryville. Drainage area is 58.2 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1943 and has been taking data periodically until now. There is some diurnal fluctuation caused by mills upstream. Records from July 18, 1988 to Sept. 30, 1997 are affected by water discharged from treatment plant, which was diverted from another drainage basin. Present location of the gage is upstream from the treatment plant and as a result, data collected since October 2002 are no longer affected by this inflow.
