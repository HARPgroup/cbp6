This river segment follows part of the flow of Zekiah Swamp Run at Newtown, MD. Gage 01660920 is located in Charles County, MD (Lat 38 29'26.1", Long 76 55'37.5") approximately 1.7 miles downstream from Kerrick Swamp. Drainage area is 79.9 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1983 and has been taking data periodically until now. Low flow is affected by groundwater diversions from municipal well fields at Waldorf and St. Charles, and occasional farm irrigation upstream from the station during summer months. There is a U.S. Geological Survey satellite data-collection platform at station.
