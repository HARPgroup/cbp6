This river segment follows part of the flow of Wills Creek near Cumberland, MD. Gage 01601500 is located in Mineral County, VA (Lat 39 40'10.6", Long 78 47'16.9") approximately 2.0 miles upstream from Cumberland, MD. Drainage area is 247 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1905 and has been taking data periodically until now. Records include drainage from numerous active and abandoned coal mines. Groundwater flow is diverted into the basin from the Georges Creek basin by Hoffman Drainage Tunnel (see station 01601420, continuous record, July 2015 to present). Miscellaneous measurements of discharge from the Hoffman Drainage Tunnel have been made in water years 1944, 1964-65, 1967-82, and 1984 by the U.S. Geological Survey, and in water years 1958 and 1959 by the Maryland Geological Survey.
