LND WDM

STR EOS WDM - edge of stream WDM 
STR INP WDM - sum of EOS and upstream OUT WDM
STR OUT WDM - output stream WDM 

IND stream  - an individual stream reach 
GRP streams - a group of streams 

0. Assimilate execution sequence of IND and GRP streams -- write out a new topology file 
1. For each NHD stream -- sum EOS and write STR EOS WDM (wdm/river/*/eos/)
	*** should be run in parallel for all COMID *** 
2. For each IND or GRP stream -- 
	*** should be run as per the IND and GRP stream topology 
	(a) sum EOS and UPSTREAM and write STR INP WDM  (wdm/river/*/stream/ INP DSN)
	(b) generate OUT WDM and write STR OUT WDM      (wdm/river/*/stream/ OUT DSN)

Note: COMID of upstream of GRP should be based on NHD topology (and not P6 topology) 
	-- Upstream of IND stream is straightforward 
	-- Upstream of GRP stream should be done by looping over each COMID in the GRP
		(a) If UP COMID is part of the GRP streams then CYCLE
		(b) Else If UP COMID is part of a different GRP streams then use STR OUT WDM of the UP GRP
		(c) Else use STR OUT WDM of the UP COMID
